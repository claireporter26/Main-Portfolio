                        <span class="aboutme_text--large">Hi I'm Claire.</span> &nbsp I am a self taught web developer based in West Sussex.<br>
                        I started learning to code a few years ago after an online video caught my interest. Although I had worked as a data analyst I hadn't considered looking into a programming career.<br>I began by building my understanding of <b>HTML</b> and then soon started to delve into the world of <b>CSS</b>. I knew that I had found something I was passionate about when my desire to study was strong enough to get me up early in the morning!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="aboutme_text">
                        I decided the best path for me to take next was <b>JavaScript</b>. This whole new type of language was initially difficult for me to pick up but I was determined to crack it and I finally wrapped my head around it, which is now allowing me to really build on my knowledge of how to use JavaScript effectively in my projects. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="aboutme_text">
                        I also have another love in my life, my little boy was born in 2019 and I have been lucky enough to spend more time with him this year than I would have normally had. It has been a balancing act to spend enough time with my family, get enough sleep and still find the time I need to continue my programming journey, but the fact that I have only goes to shows me that this really is the path for me.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="aboutme_text">
                        My current programming focus is to improve my JavaScript proficiency so that I can really excel at Front End Development and bring to each project a greater skill base and understanding. <br> My long term aim is to learn enough to become a Full Stack developer and I'm looking forward to discover which direction my passion takes me from there.
